          <h2>General Discussion</h2>
		  
	<p>As mention in the introduction, the nature of the study deviated slightly from a 'pure' heuristic evaluation to a 'needs-gather' activity. This was to a great extent because of the 'interview style' of the heuristic evaluation.  
	The interview was great at generating 'ideas' or 'discussion', but it proved a difficult task to keep the participant focused on one element at a time. As the interview progressed it was obvious that the participant was more interested in discussing the future implementations 
of gameplay, design, and story (including possible win/lose scenarios).</P>
	<p>The study was also limited by the nature of the interface. because of the lack of functionality and art assets (due to it being an early prototype), participants identified issues that would have been addressed if the prototype was more mature.</p>
	<p>In hindsight a written version of the heuristic evaluation would have helped to focus the 'experts' attention, but it would have also narrowed or restricted the views, ideas and 'feels' expressed by the participant. </p>
	<p>By engaging in this study my considerations were to generate meaningful data that could inform design. And in as far as gathering information regarding the player's emotional state (while using the interface)
 and his/her expectations, this study proved useful. But it does suffer from some serious limitation. Including a lack of statistically meaninigful (due to the small number of participants).  </p>

          <h2> Discussion of the survey questions</h2>
		  <p>I feel it fair to identify that several of the questions could have been greatly improved on, as some of the questions are redundant and other ill-formed.  
		  This, I think, could have been prevented with a more 'fully formed' prototype. The lack of concept for the game and art assests seriously limited participants engagment with the interface. This also caused the questions for the survey to besome what general and vague.
		  Errors could have be reduced by conducting a series of with a pilot tests, prior to the actual study. 
		In particularly question five could have been eliminated, as a look at the results of the previous three question, could have shown this general sense of satisfaction. </P>
		Also, the framing of question seven has too many moving parts and should have simply asked an open-ended question about the information provided in the character section. I think an opportunity to looking 
		into how well the 'humor' of the text was conveyed to the participant was more important than to check to see if it was understandable.

		<h2> Statistical analysis</h2>
		<p>Because of the relatively small sample group an indepth statistic analysis does not seen overly warrented, and therefore the study has suffered because of this lack of participants</p>
