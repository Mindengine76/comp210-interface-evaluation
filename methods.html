          <h2>Heuristic evaluation </h2>
          <p>The methods used in this evaluation are based on the Nielsen Norman Group's principles of usability and involve an interview style evaluation focusing on 'user experience' and a quantitative evaluation through a survey of three 'experts'. 
          The interview was conducted in a semi-formal setting, where the participant(s) were taken into a separate room to use the interface. The survey, in contrast, was sent to the 'experts' after they had used the interface and the results were subjected to statistical analysis. </p>          
          <br>
          <p>The reason for these two different methods; one an 'in person' observed activity and the second a review (conducted after the experience and outside of the observer's reaction), was to potentially reduce biased or overly positive/negative responses from the participants based on their relationship to the observer (myself).</p>


		<br>
		<h2> Interview process</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The interview was designed with several goals in mind, and was at heart a 'usability/needs-gathering activity'. The researcher observed the participant in a semi-formal environment to elicit a more natural and
		realistic experience. Therefore no lab tests or predefined tasks or scripts were sent to the participant.</p>
<br>
<p>The participant was allowed to initially explore the interface, then when some familiarity was established, the observer would ask the participant what he/she was doing or thinking ( questions focused on navigation, 'feel' 
and expectations). In this way generating qualitative data regarding the user's experience.</P>
<br>
<p>Once the participant had explored the interface to his satisfaction, the observer opened up a discussion on the interface based on his experience.</p>
 <br>
 <p>The interview covered the following areas: </P>
 <br>
<p>Any issues that users faced navigating the interface, the general 'feel' of the interface,  aesthetic ,  design/layout, and expectations. </p>
<br>
<p>As is the nature of interviews, the participant's comments quickly turned to his expectation and desires for the type of experience he/she would like. As part of the interview, the researcher was able to gain some valuable suggests as to what would be fun to do within the game. One questions were particularly interesting as the participant was asked how 
he would know if he won or lost the games. At this point, the participant put forward several interesting ideas to the direction the game could take and what would be the most satisfying to him/her self.</p>

		  <h2>Survey process: Questions, structure, and rationale</h2>
		  <br>
<p>The survey employed a 'funnel' question structure, starting with a broad open-ended question about their experience of the interface and then narrowed in scope to 
focus on quantifiable aspects of navigation, information display etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Question one: "After exploring the interface how did you feel about the experience? "</p>
<p>Under the question the participants were given a list of descriptive words to choose from, this was done to elicit the feel and tone of the interface as well as any other the emotions evoked by the interface. </p>
<br>
<p>Question two, three and four: "Were you able to navigate to the 3D map/Character profile/dialogue section?</p>
<br>
This was a straight functionality question, to elicit from the participants that they were able to identify the location of each section and could navigate to it. 
To fail to be able to navigate to a particular section would indicate that there was a visibility problem with the way the interface was layed out (or that a functionality issue existed, 
which turned out to be the case --please see evaluation).</p>

<p>Question five: "Overall how easy was the interface to navigate?" </p>
<br>
Yet again a navigation and visibility question. But focusing on the interface in its entirety, not a particular section (in hindsight this question could have been omitted as this 
information could have been gained from an analysis of the data. But this question also served to gauge participants satisfaction with the navigation of the interface. </p>

<p>Question six: "What did you think about the information provided in the character profile section?"</p>
<br>
Under the question, participants were given several choices regarding the quantity of information provided. Participants could choose between; too much, not enough, adequate or interesting, not interesting. 
This question was designed to gauge participants' satisfaction with the interface character profile section.</p>

<p>Question seven: "How easy was it to read and understand the information about the characters?"</p>
<br>
This question is particularly floored as it has many moving parts but was designed to focus particularly on the visibility of the information (text) presented in the profile sections. </p>

<p>Question eight: "Based on the visuals, text, and colors, what kind of game do you think the interface is for?" </p>
<br>
This was an open-ended question, designed to elicit participants 'familiarity' with the style and layout of the interface. </p>

<p>Question nine: "Based on your experience of the interface, what additional features or direction would you like the interface to include to improve your experience?" </p>
