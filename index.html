		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<br>
		
                   <p>This evaluation focuses on a prototype interface for a visual novel, rather than a completed game. The rationale being, that the methods used by HIC
				   are a particularly effective way of informing design(as discussed in my research journal). The interface being tested is my group project prototype, and it was my intention to subject it to both
				   a quantitive and qualitative investigation in order to gain meaningful feedback regarding the interface's design, feel and possible direction. In this way, the study does not satisfy 
				   the normal definition of a heuristic evaluation but draws on several elements from Human-computer interaction and the Nielsen Norman's principles of usability. 
				   
				   <br>
				   </p>
          <br>
          <P>That been said, it has provided me with an opportunity to use HIC practices and methodologies to conduct both a critical analysis of the interface's functionality, but also perform 'needs-gathering' activities. 
		  The Heuristic evaluations I have subjected the interface to are; an interview(s) focusing on 'user experience' and a quantitive survey, looking at navigation (visibility of system state), 
		  aesthetics and minimal design. The reason for this approach was to create meaningful and actionable data for the development of my group project game. By using interviewing technques to assess 'needs' and 'expectation' and 
		  surveys to evaluate functionality.</p>
		  <br>
<p>Unfornuately because the group project was subject to rapid prototyping (three prototypes in three weeks), the preparation and execution of both the prototype (functionality and aesthitics) and the study (in terms of applied methodology)
has created serious limitations that affected the meaningfulness of the data obtained.</p>

          <h2> Game Concept and Description</H2>
		  
		  <br>
          <p>The game itself is a parody of the various types of dating sims, and adds a new twist, by being set in a dungeon tower, where the player is the big boss and must select a 'new level boss' from the lower ranks of the tower.
The game is meant to have a playful, cartoon feel.</p> 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately at the time of development and testing, this concept was not fully developed and therefore the interface was lacking suitable art assets.<p>      
<br>
          <p> The interface consists of a 'dialogue' section, where the main elements of the story take place, an 'employee profile' section, where background information about the characters can be found, and a 'minimap' section, where the player can navigate about the game world. </p>
